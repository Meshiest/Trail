Oregon Trail - A ruby project
=====

This is an Oregon Trail game thing I have made in ruby over the course of 2 days (8/2/14 - 8/3/14) 12 hours

Made for the reddit Daily Programmer 8/1/14 found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ccipl/8012014_challenge_173_hard_road_trip_game/)

[Here is a list of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ZYdli#0)

To run, cd to the location of the game.rb, and `ruby game.rb`
