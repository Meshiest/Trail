Oregon Trail - A ruby project
=====

This is an Oregon Trail game thing I have made in ruby over the course of 2 days (8/2/14 - 8/3/14) 12 hours

Made for the reddit Daily Programmer 8/1/14 found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ccipl/8012014_challenge_173_hard_road_trip_game/)

[Here is a list of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ZYdli#0)

To run, cd to the location of the game.rb, and `ruby game.rb`

##Description##

Your team of 5 space elites are on a journey... somewhere. You are stuck with only 50lb of food, 5 doses of medicine, and 3 bullets. You have to keep this team save and well from various diseases, while making it to the end of the line (wherever). You may run into areas great for hunting -- Where your typing prowess will come in handy. Or places where you can buy the stuff you need to keep alive. Can your elite team of elites survive? There's only one way to find out...
